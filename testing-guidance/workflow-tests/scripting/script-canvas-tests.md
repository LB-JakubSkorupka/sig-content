# Script Canvas Workflow Tests

Testing in this area should focus on the functionality of Script Canvas editor.

## Common Issues to Watch For

Test guidance will sometimes note specific issues to watch for. The common issues below should be watched for through all testing, even if unrelated to the current workflow being tested.

* Asset processor errors when loading/saving graph files
* Warnings or assets that appear in the graph validation log
* Unresponsive UI elements

### Platforms

* Windows
* Linux

### Documents and Common Terms

* [O3DE Documentation: Script Canvas](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/)  
* [O3DE Documentation: Script Canvas Editor Interface Guide](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/get-started/editor-interface/)  
* [O3DE Documentation: User Functions](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/editor-reference/functions/)

**Script Canvas Editor**: Editing tool separate from O3DE's Editor used to create and modify script canvas graph files.

**Script Canvas Graph**: A collection of node objects that can be modified and saved to a file.

**Script Canvas Editor Basic Tools**: The 5 default tools opened and anchored to the main Script Canvas editor window; Node Palette, Variable Manager, Node Inspector, Minimap, Graph Validation.

**Script Canvas Component**: A component that can be searched and attached to an entity in O3DE editor.

**User Function**: A type of Script Canvas graph that has 2 special nodes: Entrance & Exit nodelings. User Functions are intended to give users a way to generate re-usable graph logic similar to a function in a standard programming language. When a valid User Function graph is created and saved it will appear in the Node Inspector under the 'User Functions' category.

### Area: Opening and configuring the Script Canvas Editor

**Project Requirements** 

Any project can be used, the Script Canvas gem and its gem dependencies are required.

**Product:** Visible and responsive Script Canvas editor.

**Suggested Time Box:** 30 minutes
